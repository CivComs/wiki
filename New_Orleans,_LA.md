Best Practices for New Orleans
------------------------------

### The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center

-   The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center (GNOCDC) gathers, analyzes and disseminates data to help nonprofit and civic leaders work smarter and more strategically. Operating since 1997, they are New Orleans’ sustainable data source. GNOCDC is recognized across the country for expertise in New Orleans demographics, disaster recovery indicators and actionable data visualization.
-   They start with New Orleans neighborhood data from a wide range of sources, analyze it with rigor and scientific methodology, and compile it for the public in an easy–to–understand format. Since the City doesn't have a citywide open data movement yet, the GNOCDC is the source when neighborhood leaders need statistics to attract new businesses, when staffers need to brief the President on New Orleans’ recovery and when national news outlets seek post-Katrina repopulation statistics.
-   They collect and compare data from a variety of sources to provide the most accurate picture of New Orleans available. Source examples include the U.S. Census Bureau, U.S. Postal Service, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Louisiana Department of Education, Louisiana Department of Social Services and FEMA. GNOCDC only uses data that can be updated.
-   The GNOCDC believes that reliable, targeted data can help leaders create positive community change. The data and analysis help nonprofits write grants and help government agencies determine need by neighborhood. Decision–makers need a data source that is local, objective and accessible to everyone.
