1. Embrace Risks- What are risks?

-   private vs. public data?
-   should all data be public?

2. Leave the ownership culture

-   fear of power loss
-   need for transition of priorities
-   should data be distributed
-   what are the liabilities?

3. Embrace collaboration (internal and external)

-   for increased efficiency
-   to increase information available

<!-- -->

-   Individuals must be accountable for their communication -- common sense
-   Context needs to be considered
-   There has to be a foundation of trust from public servants to public and vice versa
-   values and ethics vs. onus to public
-   What can be communicated? Internal vs. External
-   Separation of personal and work online ID
-   Understanding accountability
-   Is this the same old song?
-   Does Open Data allow for public whistle blowers?
-   Public servants now find hidden data, can this enable transparency?
