Thinking beyond technology solutions Citizens participating in government? Participatory budget How to engage residents not familiar with technology

how are citizens participatory in the budget? maybe get people involved in a particular neighbourhood in edmonton, citizen panel is juat advisory

people are motivated by money/taxes

deliberative dialogue climate change - the nature of the discussion to understand what is going on is different our most wicked problems require deeper and more sustained conversations data is useful, but conversations need to be very deliberate data can be a way to bring people into these big conversations, because it affects their day to day, its something they can grasp

once the floodgates open, will be overrun with information? will the city feel they are being micromanaged? the role of government already is to assess things

who's responsibility to get the data out to citizens? government? media?

now as a citizen, now you have access to data/information that maybe you didnt before journalists are always trying to get information, this is great for them we want to bring more information to the forefront, and make it available accountability - journalists do this, but so do others, auditors, etc. most of the time, the journalists are just making information available, not actually trying to dig for issues

how will open data change electoral politics in the city? the responsiveness of elected officials communities now have information and can make decisions community voices are fragmented and partitioned though

people will gather if its a concern to them we still need face to face projecting a common voice through social media sometimes

more voices means white noise? do we really need to know all of this information? i can pick and choose information that is relevant to where i live people working toward the collective good?

we're naturally selective paying more attention to what's happening locally. is that a good thing? how will open data reorient the perspective of citizens is it better that we look locally first? do we need to look at the bigger picture? its not just about the data, its about the uses of that data recognize that its happening already taking pride in your community, having some ownership, making govt more efficient and accountable

do we trust government to generate the data? where does it come from?

dont worry about things we dont know about... if we put the data out in the open, we'll get better data we put trust in each other already, for instance calling the radio station to report an accident, why would someone give inaccurate data?

what decisions might the city make that would impact local focus going larger? sociologist Alexis de Tocqueville

getting people involved who are tech savvy? not a new challenge. how do we get people involved, period?
