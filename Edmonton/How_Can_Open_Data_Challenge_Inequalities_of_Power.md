Forms of an open data regime

Question proposed by David Kahn:

“Many different ways in which data can be released, some of which would allow information to continue to be controlled versus distributed. How do we decide and/or ensure that data is distributed?”

Eg. an anti task coalition using the way the City is spending money on open data could be basis for political platform.

Data is not useful until is it laid out in a useful manner, data can be available, but it is how you use it.

Cautious open data as a panacea to fix problems, the application and capacity is crucial. Some people may not have the technical skill to apply it properly, thus people in power could continue to exploit it.

The developer perspective versus the social scientist perspective.

Example of Mini eyes – takes data sets and allows you to visualize and collaborate date sets.

What framings are powerful, what framing are going to become powerful?

As such, does the city have to regulate what happens once the data is “out there”?

The role of companies is creating the user-friendly interface that allows the data to be accessible. Small start-ups are just as able to capitalize on this as well as big corporations. Eg. Google Transit

Do we want companies building upon the availability of open data?

Tools of collaboration, tools of framing need to be combined with open data.

Two barriers to the successful application of open data application: One barrier to access is a fee, and the other is the ability to use it – potential result of inequality.

We didn’t build libraries before everyone could read; we lowered the cost and barriers and made it available.

The handheld portability and application of the data is the Guttenberg Press of the open data.

How do you connect community-based organizations with open data? Open data is not the exciting part, it’s the culture shift that it allows and the sense of openness that evolves.

Do we want other data generators, or do we want the same ones?

Currently, provincial archives keep every scrap of paper, would we do the same with open data?

We acknowledge that there are billions of data sets, what do we prioritize?

Doesn’t that lead to a new form of inequality?

Let’s find the system and tools that can build life to the data. Everyone is missing a piece of the puzzle in the data sets that they have.

What about the people who are not onboard with open data, which are also, in most cases, not interested in engaging in democracy through new methods as technology allows. How does one “sell” them on the role and opportunity for open data?

There is recognition of the capitalization of data versus democratization of data.

Will government do the best job at releasing open data?
