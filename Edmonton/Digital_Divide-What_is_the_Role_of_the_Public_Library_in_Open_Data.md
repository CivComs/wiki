Topic suggestions:

-   Age vs. Innovation
-   What role can the public library play in supporting open gov?
-   Digital Divide: Is technology enabling citizen participation? Is it only targeting rich citizens? How can open government be a platform for poor people in Edmonton and Alberta?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital Divide:

-   Technology can create a digital divide
-   Open data can enable increased access to information
-   The digital divide isn't just between the rich and poor, it can be a divide between cultures and generations
-   New technology is allowing us to communicate through different modes
-   There is a need for different groups to get more familiar with technologies
-   Could this be one of the roles of libraries in the future? Giving access to those with less resources?
-   If awareness was raised and education was provided, could we close the generation gap?
-   Even if there is a divide, this new technology gives belief to many in the community
-   There is certainly value added
-   Technology can empower communities and individuals to interact with government and non-profits in new ways

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Role of Libraries:

-   They can enable experiences
-   A place where people can access information, if data is online, will people still go to libraries?
-   Librarians can use the data? They can help citizens use/ understand that data.
-   A library is not just a building, it is a place where community can come to get education, learn about different topics
-   There is a lot of outreach at libraries, (help with grant writing etc.)
-   Libraries could be the link between government and non-profits
-   The role of libraries in this new age of technology is certainly relevant
