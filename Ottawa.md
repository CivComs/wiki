City Council Recommendations
----------------------------

COMMITTEE and COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS [<http://ottawa.ca/calendar/ottawa/citycouncil/csedc/2010/05-04/englishdisposition56.htm>](http://ottawa.ca/calendar/ottawa/citycouncil/csedc/2010/05-04/englishdisposition56.htm)

That Council:

-   adopt the principles of Open Government, as described in this report, and declare the City of Ottawa data to be “Open”; and
-   approve that the City fund an application open data contest to be funded from the City’s one-time and unforeseen account with prize money and incentives totalling $50,000; and
-   approve that Information Technology Services and Corporate Communications be encouraged to involve members of the public and others knowledgeable about open data applications in assisting the City in the contest, particularly in developing the criteria and website for the City.

Best Practices for Ottawa
-------------------------

-   Defining open data: *For data to be truly open, it has to be available with a license that gives users the right to use the data, merge it with other data sets, modify it, and re-distribute it.*
-   Seeking the open source-open data-open standards, like Vancouver.
-   In May 2010, City Council approved the Open Data report, and with it adopted the principles of Open Data, and approved an application contest to begin in the fall of 2010. The City strongly supports citizen participation as a vital component of planning, building sustainable communities, and encourage collaboration.
