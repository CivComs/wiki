The **Civic Commons Wiki** is a collaborative encyclopedia documenting best-practices and open standards for file formats, APIs, agile development processes, open source software, and supporting policies and licenses in the civic sector. 

Civic Commons was originally a partnership between [OpenPlans](http://www.openplans.org) and [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org). As of 2015, neither organization is affiliated with Civic Commons - it is an entirely community run resource.
