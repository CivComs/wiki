As of April 2013, San Diego is in the early stages of developing an Open Data Policy, driven in part by the Mayor's appointment of a Director of Open Government. Other organizations in the area that advocate for open data include:

` * `[`Open` `San` `Diego`](http://opensandiego.org/)
` * `[`San` `Diego` `Regional` `Data` `Library`](http://sandiegodata.org/)
