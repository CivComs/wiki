Best Practices for Nanaimo
--------------------------

-   Modeled their data catalogue after the United States' [Data.gov](http://www.data.gov) and Washington, D.C's [OCTO Labs](http://octo.dc.gov/DC/OCTO/) in gathering all of the City's open data sources in a central location for ease of access by the public
-   Creating a central sign-in portal for the public, thereby centralizing the information. Users can create their own OpenIDs to join the portal.
