-   The Open311 APIs are standards for interactions with citizens that typically occur through with a CRM. The two kinds of interactions are service requests ([Open311 Inquiry API](http://wiki.open311.org/GeoReport_v2)) and general questions ([Open311 Inquiry API](http://wiki.open311.org/Inquiry_v1)). There's likely a need for a higher level standard around the basic interaction or standards around other kinds of interactions.
