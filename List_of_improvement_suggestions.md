Organization
------------

-   Would it be better to organize by civic function as well as by data, applications, etc? [Applications](/Applications "wikilink") seems more like a list of civic functions. People looking for information are often going to be looking for information around a functional topic.

General
-------

-   Each page should have a category. This offers another way to navigate the site.
-   Use guidelines, e.g. like [Wikipedia guidelines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing#Policies_and_conventions).
-   Improve capitalization to match [Wikipedia conventions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_%28capitalization%29).

Redirects
---------

-   [Civic software](/Civic_Software "wikilink") - complete migration to marketplace.

Spam cleanup
------------

There are many spam pages currently in the site (too many to list here). It would help to have a greater pool of editors who can delete spam pages.
