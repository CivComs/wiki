Open Source Projects
--------------------

-   [OpenGovernment.org Developer Center](http://opengovernment.org/pages/developer) and [OpenGovernment](https://github.com/opengovernment) & [OpenCongress](https://github.com/opencongress) on Github
-   [NY State Senate Open Legislation system](/Civic_Stack/OpenLegislation "wikilink")
-   [Northglenn, Colorado, US](http://webdocs.northglenn.org/) (This is the system referred to by Dan Schmick in the comments of the the thread ["Has any local government implemented free and/or open source software to aid in recordkeeping?"](http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/questions/question/20072) in the [ICMA Open Source Software group](http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/groups/group/1126). Schmick indicates that Northglenn would be happy to release their stuff as open source; it's more an issue of time and resources than willingness -- it's not really packaged for release, as of June 2010.)
-   [The State Decoded](http://www.statedecoded.com/) - platform for publishing state legal codes.
