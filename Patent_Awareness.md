When working on an open technology project, it is important to be aware that even though the software licenses themselves might be permissive, there may be patents that affect one's ability to use the code. In some cases, these patents may be held by contractors on the project itself, who have agreed to open source terms for the code, or for a standard around which the code is being designed, but who have not committed to making their patents available under similar terms (and who may not always reveal the existence of the patents unless asked).

We would like to provide model contract language to help governments ensure that they or their users don't get bitten by stealth patents after implementation. However, until we have that, this page holds some examples of patents affecting the adoption and use of open technology and/or open standards.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambus#Lawsuits> Rambus was found to be tailoring patent applications based on ongoing standards discussions that were happening in public.
-   <http://www.gibsondunn.com/publications/Documents/Royal-Tessar-DiVincenzo-DeterringPatantAmbush.pdf> Similar to the Rambus memory case above, but this time with QualComm.
-   <http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/11/dell.shtm> Dell agrees to drop enforcement of patent on popular computer data-bus design.
-   <http://www.patentlyo.com/patent/2008/01/ieee-standards.html> N-Data apparently promised very cheap patent fees, then when the standard was adopted turned around and demanded much larger fees. Somewhat controversially, the US FTC ruled that N-Data could not do that, stating "Respondent engaged in conduct that was both oppressive and coercive when it engaged in efforts to exploit licensees that were locked into a technology by the adoption of a standard.‚Äù.
-   <http://en.swpat.org/wiki/> "End Software Patents" is a group whose goal is obvious from their name; although Civic Commons does not currently have any stance on software patents, the ESP site provides a good list of well-known patent infringement suits, and as it cites primary and secondary sources, that list is useful here regardless of ESP's own position. Specific relevant pages:
    -   <http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Harm_to_standards>
    -   <http://en.swpat.org/wiki/Free_software_projects_harmed_by_software_patents>
-   *More examples welcome.*
-   [Standard Setting, Patents, and Hold-Up](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/shapiro/standards2007.pdf) Thorough economic analysis of the incentives and policy implications.

It seems like there is a set of standards harmed by patents, and a set of free software projects harmed by patents, but the \*specific\* method of patent ambush (most of the specific examples above) have not affected free software projects particularly.
