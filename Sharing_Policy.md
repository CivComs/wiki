Some of the cities have drawn from one another's policies in drafting open government legislation. For example, there is some language that Portland reused from the Vancouver Open Motion in their legislation. Furthermore, San Francisco has provided a great precedent for packaging policies and initiatives in ways that can be reused by other cities.
