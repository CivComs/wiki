Research / links from Cynthia Gibson & mailing list ::

Matt Leighninger who's arguably the eminence gris on citizen-centered public deliberation/governance wrote the following for the IBM Foundation: <http://www.businessofgovernment.org/report/using-online-tools-engage-public>

Clay Shirky's latest stuff (not necessarily targeted to low-income people, BUT must reads, since he's the seminal guy on all this stuff): <http://us-mg5.mail.yahoo.com/neo/launch>?.rand=1d3250qi9j88o\#minty

Philanthropy's role in creating a connected America - Benton Foundation - Outlines how foundations can support capacity building and expanding broadband access to underserved communities by leveraging the federal Broadband Infrastructure and Broadband Technologies Opportunity Programs through matching grants and partnerships. It's a bit outdated (2009), but may have some stuff.
