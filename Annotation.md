Some commentary on annotation:

The annotation approach to commenting as demonstrated by [stet](http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-1.html) or [co-ment](http://www.co-ment.net) provides a significant improvement in the utility of generic comment-field based feedback systems. This approach should be decoupled from serving as the central function of an app and made available as more of a plugin or even as a service (like the [disqus](http://disqus.com/) comment service) so that it can be used as the commenting system for any content that deserves collaborative editing without being a live open wiki (Ian has insight on this for building [Commentary](http://pythonpaste.org/commentary/), but already [Diigo](http://www.diigo.com/) does this pretty well). Legal documents such as legislation on Publicmarkup.org is a good example, but in many cases any wiki talk page, like mediawiki's discussion pages, could be vastly improved if they were overhauled with a system that allowed the discussion to occur directly in the context of disputed content.

Improving the discussion page system for wikis could provide for a more sane and easily manageable model of collaborative editing. Instead of having the page always open to edits, you leave it closed but open for annotations, then when the annotations have significantly built up you temporarily open the page for edits. This allows you to develop more meaningfully differentiated versions and to peg the annotations to specific revisions.

*(January 2010 update)* It looks like this might be possible by combining the [ShiftSpace highlighter](http://www.shiftspace.org/spaces/highlights/) with [MediaWiki LiquidThreads](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:LiquidThreads)
