-   [San Francisco](http://sfdbi.org/index.aspx?page=214): These are .XLS spreadsheets published on a monthly basis. Go here for more info: <http://www.datasf.org/search.php?search=building>. Here is how the data is used on EveryBlock: <http://sf.everyblock.com/building-permits/>
-   [Atlanta](http://atlantaga.govhost.com/government/planning_onlinepermits.aspx?section=City%20Services): This is not a "feed", just a series of text files like [this](http://apps.atlantaga.gov/citydir/dpcd/dpcd%20web/buildings/ag2009.txt). This is definitely not a preferred method of publishing data, but it is consistent, so that a developer would only have to write a scraper once. Here is how the data is used on EveryBlock: <http://atlanta.everyblock.com/building-permits/by-date/2009/12/1/103138/>
-   [Charlotte/ Mecklenburg County](http://dwexternal.co.mecklenburg.nc.us/ids/RptGrid01.aspx?rpt=Daily_Building_Permits_Issued): This is an interesting case. Many years ago, they launched their "Integrated Data Store", a system of searches and download files. It is not a "feed", really (XML, RSS), but it does allow for the user to configure a search and download a reliably formatted .csv file. Here is how the data is used on EveryBlock: <http://charlotte.everyblock.com/building-permits/>
-   [Boston permit search](http://www.cityofboston.gov/isd/building/asofright/default.asp): This is an example where the data is not provided in any format other than a Web search. The goal of any city should be to eliminate the need to scrape Web databases. Here is how the data is used on EveryBlock: <http://boston.everyblock.com/building-permits/by-date/2010/1/22/339007/>
