Below is a summary pitch for Civic Commons -- a template for approaching other groups who should know about this effort. Obviously, each use will probably need a custom introduction, explaining the need to that person or group in their particular context. The body text may need to recipient-specific tweaking as well in some cases. Treat this as a template from which to work.

The Civic Commons Network
-------------------------

**Coordinating Open Technology among Public Agencies**

`CivicCommons.org`

The [Civic Commons](/Civic_Commons "wikilink") network will provide sustained organizational capacity to assist public agencies -- such as city, state, and national governments -- in the development and adoption of open systems and collaborative technologies. It is an answer to the question of whether every city really needs to write its own transit apps, or whether every state agency really needs to come up with its own variants on, for example, open-source procurement and contracting language.

Public agencies rarely have the organizational capacity to do collaborative development in concert with equivalent agencies elsewhere. As a result, the same piece of infrastructure is often purchased repeatedly, and the same technology projects are redeveloped over and over again by staff in many agencies. This lack of coordination not only leads to duplicated effort, it propagates incompatible technologies and inconsistent interfaces. When collaborative development does take place, it is too often limited to the tenures of the individuals who initiated it, rather than being built into a permanent organizational structure.

By providing a long-term, stable home for the coordination of technology creation and collaborative practices across different agencies, Civic Commons seeks to improve interoperability and shareability, and to support the development and maintenance of a shared civic software and protocols, partly built through projects that outgrow their site-specific origins. Civic Commons will also provide optional technical infrastructure, such as data and project hosting, in order to remove common but easily-solved technical obstacles to collaboration.

Civic Commons's goal is a culture of collaborative development among public agencies, leading toward open information systems. Civic Commons provides public agencies with a sustainable infrastructure for realizing shared efficiencies, standardization, and innovation. Using open systems in the public sector helps avoid technological lock-in, and collaborating on open systems promotes a shared interest between governments and non-government vendors in servicing and extending a body of common civic code.

The Civic Commons network is being developed with support from:
