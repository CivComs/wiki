Data Platforms
--------------

This page is meant to catalog generic data platforms rather than platforms that are oriented at a specific domain or kind of dataset. For platforms aimed at specific kinds of data, please go through the [Civic Ontology](/Civic_Ontology "wikilink") list.

For lists of data catalogs -- the actual data, not the software platforms behind the data -- see [Open Data Initiatives](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Initiatives#Open_Data_Initiatives) and especially the [comprehensive lists of open government data catalogs](http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Initiatives#Comprehensive_Lists_of_Open_Government_Data_Catalogs).

Data Platform Survey
--------------------

This list is just meant to survey technology platforms for organizing and publishing data; for information on data catalogs themselves (i.e., focused on the data, not the software), see the pointers at the top of this page.
