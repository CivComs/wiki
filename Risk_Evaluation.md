The City of Seattle has developed an evaluation rubric that establishes a thorough review of each dataset to ensure it passes a set of requirements for being made open. The rubric uses the 8 Priniciples of Open Data as a framework and considers risk factors such as security and privacy. Seattle CIO Bill Schrier has said that this evaluation can be referenced and adapted by others with the understanding that the example provided here is a draft and not a final version of their evaluation process.
