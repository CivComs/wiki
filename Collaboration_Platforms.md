This page is a stub and needs clean-up

The architecture of the internet and the web make them intrinsically collaborative platforms, but web-based collaborative platforms tend to focus on a facilitating a few different patterns for collaboration. This page is meant to outline those patterns and catalog platforms that facilitate them.

One set of patterns often shows up within the context of brainstorming and issue-reporting. Here, they are referred to as, Ideation, Inquiry, and Issue-reporting. These different properties tend to be combined in different ways depending on the context. For brainstorming, both ideation and inquiry are often combined while for issue-reporting, both ideas and issues are often combined. Some platforms, such as Get Satisfaction, will combine all three.

Another distinction made within these patterns is whether the response is meant to be more objective or more subjective.
