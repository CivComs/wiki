Vendors Who Provide Sandboxing
------------------------------

*2012-01-12: This list is currently more of a reminder of what needs to be filled in than a useful reference source. These are vendors who provide some kind of app sandboxing service for at least some apps that are useful in a civic/government context, but what we really need here is (say) a chart that shows, for each app, which vendors offer free or low-cost trial sandboxing.*
