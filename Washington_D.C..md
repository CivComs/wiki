Best Practices from Washington, D.C.
------------------------------------

-   Washington, D.C.'s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) talk about the programs in DC at Digital Capital Week (DC Week) - [notes](http://dc.thecityfix.com/event-wrap-up-online-engagement-for-sustainable-urban-mobility/)
-   OCTO opened vast arrays of District data to public view—a total of 405 datasets on subjects ranging from crime to building permits to historic sites to procurement. OCTO’s two “Apps for Democracy” contests invited the developer community—and the public at large—to compete for prizes by developing new software applications to make the data more accessible and useful for the public.
-   Using OCTO data and DC Public Square, developers and netizens can customize their data collection and after finishing their work, they can place it on their own, or other, websites and even start online discussions on the data and visualizations.
-   "And it’s all open to everyone, completely free of charge." [Cited from Press Release](http://octo.dc.gov/DC/OCTO/About+OCTO/News+Room/Press+Releases/District+of+Columbia+Launches+New+Data+Visualization+Tools)
-   The goal is to allow the public "to slice and dice government data in brand-new ways" and make government more efficient, effective, and transparent.
