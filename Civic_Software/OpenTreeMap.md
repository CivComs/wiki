OpenTreeMap is open source software for collaborative, geography-enabled urban tree inventory.

Features of the software include:

-   Search for trees based on species, location, or advanced filters such as date planted, sponsor, or whether the tree is native to the region
-   Add individual trees or load tree datasets into the system
-   Edit existing tree information and upload tree photos
-   Export data as KML, CSV, or shapefiles
-   Automatic calculations of ecosystem benefits (water, energy, air quality) based on a tree's species and diameter
-   Administrative review option including an option to make some edits pending

The code for OpenTreeMap is available on Github at <https://github.com/azavea/OpenTreeMap>
