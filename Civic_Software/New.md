This is the template for a new [Civic Software](/Civic_Software "wikilink") entry. Here's how you use it to create a new civic app page:

1.  Create the desired page by visiting it (e.g., go to [Civic_Software/New_Page](/Civic_Software/New_Page "wikilink"), but adjust "New_Page" to be the name of the new entry) and then clicking *edit*.
2.  "Subclude" this page (the one you're reading right now) by writing **{{subst::Civic Software/New}}**
3.  Save, then open the newly-created page for editing.
4.  Uncomment the two ''' ''' and their two corresponding ''' ''' tags.
5.  Fill in the rest of the information on the page as indicated by the template. You can use [this](/Civic_Software/App_Store_DC "wikilink") as an example.
6.  After saving, go to the main [Civic Software](/Civic_Software "wikilink") page and add the entry using this syntax: **{{:Civic_Software/New_Page}}**. That will cause the overview from your new page to be included ("transcluded") into the main Civic Software table.

(If you're really curious, read about mediawiki [transclusion markup](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Transclusion#Transclusion_markup). From this page we're transcluding only the table below; it nests some further transclusion commands -- commented out here because of the problem described at [1](http://dpaste.org/93tS/) -- so that only the appropriate parts of the new item page will in turn be transcluded into the main [Civic Software](/Civic_Software "wikilink") overview page.)
