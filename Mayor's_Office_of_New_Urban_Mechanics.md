The Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics — initially conceived in Boston by Mayor Thomas M. Menino and now being replicated in cities across the country — is an organizational model that helps cities innovate by aggregating risk, building partnerships, and encouraging experimentation in government. Projects have ranged from crowdsourcing development of sensor-driven apps to government-to-government resource sharing.
